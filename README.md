This repository implements a **Smart Wallet**, inspired by the [Ethereum Blockchain Developer Bootcamp With Solidity (2023)](https://www.udemy.com/course/blockchain-developer/) Udemy course.

It uses a truffle project for the implementation, testing, and deployment. 

Included are the implementation for the `depositMoney`, `withdrawMoney`, and `giveAllowance` functions and the corresponding tests, along with the deployment script.
